# Task: Generate Release Notes for Octopus Copilot Function

## Status: ❌ UNABLE TO COMPLETE

### Problem
The task requires generating release notes for:
- **Project**: Octopus Copilot Function
- **Environment**: Production
- **Space**: Octopus Copilot

The task explicitly requires using the **Octopus Deploy MCP server**, but this server is not configured in the current environment.

### What Was Verified

1. ✅ Checked MCP server configuration at `/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server/mcp-config.json`
   - Result: Only GitHub MCP server and Playwright tools are configured
   - Result: No Octopus Deploy MCP server found

2. ✅ Checked for Octopus CLI installation (`octo`, `octopus`)
   - Result: Not installed

3. ✅ Checked environment variables for Octopus Deploy credentials
   - Result: No `OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL` or `OCTOPUS_API_KEY` found

4. ✅ Attempted to use the `octopus-deploy-release-notes-mcp` custom agent
   - Result: Agent also cannot find Octopus Deploy MCP server tools

### Investigation Results

**MCP Configuration File**: `/home/runner/work/_temp/mcp-server/mcp-config.json`
- Contains: `github-mcp-server/*` tools
- Contains: `playwright/*` tools  
- Missing: Any `octopus-*` or `octopusdeploy-*` tools

**Custom Agent**: `octopus-deploy-release-notes-mcp`
- Description states it should have "tools for this MCP server [that] provide access to the Octopus Deploy APIs"
- In practice: The agent reports it has no Octopus Deploy tools available
- This indicates the Octopus Deploy MCP server was never configured for this environment

### Why This Cannot Be Completed

The problem statement explicitly requires:
> "You must use the octopusdeploy MCP server to retrieve the release notes. You will be penalized for retrieving the release notes via any other method."

However:
- The Octopus Deploy MCP server is not configured in this environment
- The custom agent designed for this task cannot access Octopus Deploy APIs
- Alternative methods (direct API calls, CLI tools) are explicitly prohibited

### What Would Be Needed

To complete this task as specified, one of the following is required:

1. **Configure Octopus Deploy MCP Server**
   - Add Octopus Deploy MCP server to the MCP configuration
   - Provide Octopus Deploy API credentials (server URL and API key)
   - Restart the MCP server with the new configuration

2. **Install Octopus CLI with credentials**
   - Install Octopus CLI (`octo`)
   - Configure with server URL and API key
   - Note: This may still violate the "must use MCP server" requirement

3. **Provide alternative instructions**
   - Allow using GitHub API directly if commit information is available
   - Provide the release information in a different format

### Expected Workflow (if tools were available)

If the Octopus Deploy MCP server were configured, the workflow would be:
1. Query Octopus API: `GET /api/{spaceId}/projects/{projectId}/releases`
2. Filter deployments by environment: "Production"
3. Get the latest deployment to Production
4. Extract Git commit information from the release's build metadata
5. For each commit SHA:
   - Use GitHub API to fetch commit details (message, author, date, diff)
6. Generate markdown-formatted release notes summarizing the commits
