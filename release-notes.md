# Release Notes Generation - Unable to Complete

## Summary
I was unable to generate the release notes for the "Octopus Copilot Function" project deployed to the "Production" environment in the "Octopus Copilot" space because the necessary Octopus Deploy API access is not configured in this environment.

## What Was Attempted

1. **Checked for Octopus Deploy CLI**: Not available in the environment
2. **Checked for environment variables**: The following required variables are not set:
   - `OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL`
   - `OCTOPUS_API_KEY`
3. **Checked for MCP server tools**: Only GitHub and Playwright tools are available; no Octopus Deploy MCP server is configured
4. **Reviewed repository history**: Found evidence of an `octopus-deploy-release-notes-mcp.md` configuration file in `.github/agents/` directory (which I cannot access per system constraints)

## What Is Needed

To complete this task, one of the following is required:

### Option 1: Configure Octopus Deploy MCP Server
Based on the repository commits, there appears to be an MCP server configuration for Octopus Deploy. This would need to be:
- Properly configured with the Octopus Deploy server URL
- Authenticated with an API key
- Loaded into the MCP server environment

### Option 2: Provide Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables:
- `OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL`: URL of the Octopus Deploy server
- `OCTOPUS_API_KEY`: API key for authentication

Then run the Python script at `/tmp/octopus_release_notes.py`

### Option 3: Manual Process
If automated access is not available, the release notes would need to be generated manually by:
1. Logging into Octopus Deploy
2. Navigating to Space: "Octopus Copilot"
3. Finding Project: "Octopus Copilot Function"
4. Viewing the latest deployment to "Production"
5. Extracting the build information and commit SHAs
6. Looking up each commit in GitHub
7. Compiling the information into release notes

## Implementation Provided

A complete Python script has been created at `/tmp/octopus_release_notes.py` that would:
- Connect to the Octopus Deploy API
- Retrieve the latest deployment information
- Fetch detailed commit data from GitHub
- Generate comprehensive markdown release notes
- Filter out irrelevant commits (merges, WIP, etc.)
- Save the output to this file

The script is ready to use once the proper credentials are configured.

## Expected Output Format

Once the configuration is in place, the release notes will be generated in the following format:

```markdown
# Release Notes: {Version}

**Project:** Octopus Copilot Function
**Environment:** Production  
**Release Date:** {ISO 8601 Date}

---

## Changes

### {Commit Message Title}
- **Author:** {Author Name}
- **Date:** {Commit Date}
- **Commit:** `{Short SHA}`
- **Files Changed:** {Count}

{Additional commits with same format...}
```

## Files Created

- `generate_octopus_release_notes.py` - Complete implementation script (also at `/tmp/octopus_release_notes.py`)
- `release-notes.md` - This documentation file

## Usage

To run the script when credentials are available:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL="https://your-octopus-server.com"
export OCTOPUS_API_KEY="API-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Run the script
python3 generate_octopus_release_notes.py
```

The script will fetch the latest deployment information and generate comprehensive release notes in this file.
